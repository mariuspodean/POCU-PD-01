# Final project 

Based on a topic of your choosing, define the functional requirements for a web application. The requirements must properly describe all use cases. 
Based on the previously defined requirements, implement the web application using Django.

Project assets:
* the requirements file (txt / md), and
* the Django project source code.

We will be using SQLite as a database, so the database file must be included also in the project assets.

The web project will have as many applications as you find suited, but it will have at least 3 pages. When referring to a web page, we are discussing here all the infrastructure required for it: a model with the associated migrations, views and templates. From these 3 pages, at least one should contain a web form.

Components share in grading:
* problem description and requirements: 30%, and
* implementation: 70%

Timeframe:
* 04.08 - Project presentation (neither the project nor the presentation will be graded at this point),
* 06.08 20.00 - Submission deadline (pull request in Github & zip archive in Moodle).

Note: Based on this project you will prepare a presentation for the ANC evaluation.
